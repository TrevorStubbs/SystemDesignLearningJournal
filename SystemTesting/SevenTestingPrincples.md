# The 7 Principle of Software Testing

## 1 Testing shows presence of defects
    - Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects are found, it is not a proof of correctness.
## 2 Exhaustive testing is impossible
    - Risk assessment to focus on the most important risks
## 3 Early Testing
    - Start as soon as possible.
## 4 Defect Clustering
    - A small number of modules contain most of the defects detected
    - Focus on these modules first
## 5 Pesticide Paradox
    - If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually the same test cases will no longer find new bugs.
    - Regularly review and revise test cases
## 6 Testing is Context Dependant
    - How you test is focused on the needs of the system.
## 7 Absence of Errors- Fallacy
    - If the system is error free but doesn't fulfill the needs of the client it is not good software.
