## Automation Process
### Test Tool Selection
- Tool selection depends on the technology that SUT/AUT is built on. 
- Build a Proof of Concept on the SUT/AUT

### Define scope of Automation
- Area of the SUT/AUT which will be automated

### Planning, Design and Development
- Create the Automation strategy & plan.

### Test Execution
- Automation Scripts are executed during this phase

### Maintenance
- When the SUT/AUT are updated with each cycle the Automation Scripts needs to be "added", "reviewed", and/or "maintained" for each release cycle.
