# Types of Testing

## Unit Testing
- Test how each individual module works in isolation of other modules. 

## System Testing
- Concerned with the behavior of a system as a whole.
- Focuses checks complete end to end scenarios (the way the user would use the system).
- Non-Functional requirements are also checked in the phase

## Acceptance Testing
- Done by the client location by the client
- Doesn't focus on finding defects but whether the system meets the client's requirements.
- Alpha Testing - A set of employees of the client
- Beta Testing - A small of customers of the client

## Integration Testing
- Test the communication between modules.

## Smoke/Sanity Testing
- Check critical functionalities of the system before it is accepted for major testing.
- Quick and non-exhaustive
- Goal: Check for system health (not defects)

## Maintenance Testing
- Testing of a deployed system
    - Tests enhancements
    - System changes
    
## Regression Testing
- Testing that modification of software has not created errors or unintended side-effects.

## Non-Functional Testing
- Testing of a system's:
    - Performance
    - Usability
    - Load factor
- Performance Testing:
    - Check & Fine tune system response time
- Load Testing:
    - Test the system at difference loads
